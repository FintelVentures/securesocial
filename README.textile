h1. A fork of SecureSocial

This is a fork of SecureSocial, originally developped by Jorge Aliss. We heavily use this plugin for one of our projects, and we sometimes want to change it. Even though We send pull requests, we don't want to stop our development unitil they are merged, so we decided to fork it. Basically, we send a PR of every change, but it's up to the original author whether the change is merged or not.

Below is the original README as of Mar 12, 2015.
